# Rewards
## Effect
The reward type is `pufferfish_unofficial_additions:effect`

The data consists of:
- `effect`: The effect in the format of `namespace:path` (e.g. `minecraft:regeneration`)
- `amplifier`: The "level" of the effect
  - For the types `GRANT` and `IMMUNE` this value has to be between `0` and `255`
- `type`: The type of application
  - `GRANT`: The effect will be applied and kept with infinite duration
  - `IMMUNE`: Effect applications equal or below the specified amplifier will not be applied
  - `MODIFY` Effects applications will be modified with the specified amplifier and duration modification
- `duration_modification`: Only applicable to the type `MODIFY` in the format of `<operation><amount>` (e.g. `x1.25` -> multiply by `1.25`)
  - This element is optional (even for `MODIFY`)

Apply effects (infinite duration):
- Before removing the reward from the definition you'll have to reset the skills (or manually remove the effects yourself)

```json
{
  "type": "pufferfish_unofficial_additions:effect",
  "data": {
    "effect": "minecraft:regeneration",
    "amplifier": 0,
    "type": "GRANT"
  }
}
```

Grant immunity up to a certain amplifier:

```json
{
  "type": "pufferfish_unofficial_additions:effect",
  "data": {
    "effect": "minecraft:wither",
    "amplifier": 1,
    "type": "IMMUNE"
  }
}
```

Modify duration and / or amplifier of incoming effects:
- If the duration reaches `0` due to modifications the effect will not be applied
- If the amplifier goes below `0` due to modifications the effect will not be applied

```json
{
  "type": "pufferfish_unofficial_additions:effect",
  "data": {
    "effect": "minecraft:slowness",
    "amplifier": -2,
    "duration_modification": "/2.5",
